#OGRoads


Kohi Style roads plugin.

Commands:

/cleanroad <width> <distance> // You can set the width and distance , for example /cleanroad 5 100
  
/roadgen <blockID,blocksID> // You can set one or more blocks.
  
  #Note
  
  To use the /roadgen command, first you need to clear the roads with the /cleanroad command, because with this command you generate a cache to get the width and distance
  to generate the roads later.
